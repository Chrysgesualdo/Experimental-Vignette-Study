# Project Title: Experimental Vignette Study â€“ Health-Related Expectation Violations

## Techniques Used:
- Experimental design
- Descriptive statistics
- Vignette study
- Data collection via online questionnaires
- Repeated measures ANCOVAs
- SPSS Statistics Software

## Summary:
I investigated how university students cope with health-related expectation violations. First, I designed a 2x2x2 experimental vignette study to manipulate valence (positive vs. negative), discrepancy magnitude (larger vs. smaller), and controllability (control vs. no control). I collected data from 297 students through online questionnaires. Using SPSS, I performed repeated measures ANCOVAs to analyze the data. The study revealed key predictors of coping mechanisms.
