## Summary

In this project, I investigated how university students cope with health-related expectation violations. First, I designed a 2x2x2 experimental vignette study to manipulate valence (positive vs. negative), discrepancy magnitude (larger vs. smaller), and controllability (control vs. no control). I collected data from 297 students through online questionnaires. Using SPSS, I performed repeated measures ANCOVAs to analyze the data. The study revealed key predictors of coping mechanisms.
